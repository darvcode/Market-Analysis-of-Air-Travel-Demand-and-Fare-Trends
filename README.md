# Flight Delay Prediction Project

## Problem Description

Airlines and airports constantly strive to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. One key factor in this effort is the ability to predict flight delays. By analyzing historical flight data, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts whether a flight will be delayed based on various factors.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Description:** The dataset contains comprehensive information about airline flight routes within the US, including details such as departure and arrival times, distances, and more.
- **Source:** [All Airline Flight Routes in the US on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oleksiimartusiuk/all-airline-fight-routes-in-the-us).

## Features

- **Flight ID:** Unique identifier for each flight.
- **Airline:** The airline operating the flight.
- **Departure Airport:** The airport from which the flight departs.
- **Arrival Airport:** The airport at which the flight arrives.
- **Scheduled Departure Time:** The scheduled time of departure.
- **Scheduled Arrival Time:** The scheduled time of arrival.
- **Actual Departure Time:** The actual time the flight departed.
- **Actual Arrival Time:** The actual time the flight arrived.
- **Distance:** The distance between the departure and arrival airports.
- **Delay:** A binary variable indicating whether the flight was delayed (1) or not (0).

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify key features, and calculate summary statistics.
- **Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Objective:** Remove duplicate records, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.
- **Tools:** Pandas, Scikit-learn.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Objective:** Extract additional features such as the day of the week, month, and peak hour indicators. Create interaction features to capture relationships between variables.
- **Tools:** Pandas.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Objective:** Visualize the distribution of delays across different airlines, airports, and times of day using heatmaps, bar charts, and line plots.
- **Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 5. Machine Learning
- **Objective:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train various models to predict flight delays, including:
  - **Logistic Regression:** To establish a baseline model.
  - **Random Forest:** To capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Gradient Boosting:** For improved performance.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** To handle high-dimensional data.
- **Tools:** Scikit-learn.

### 6. Model Evaluation and Selection
- **Objective:** Compare the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
- **Tools:** Scikit-learn.

### 7. Deployment (Optional)
- **Objective:** Create a web application using Flask or Django to deploy the predictive model. The application will allow users to input flight details and receive predictions about potential delays.
- **Tools:** Flask/Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript.
